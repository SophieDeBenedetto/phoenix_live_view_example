# Phoenix Live View Example App
A dummy app to demonstrate how to use Phoenix Live View. Read all about it in [this blog post.](https://www.thegreatcodeadventure.com/walk-though-of-phoenix-live-view/)

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
